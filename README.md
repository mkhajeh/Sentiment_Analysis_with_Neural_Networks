# Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks

In this project, I built my own deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from StockTwits, a social network for investors and traders. My model was able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative. From this, I was able to generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.

This project was the sixth project (out of Eight Projects) in **AI for trading NanoDegree Program**, offered by Udacity. The rest of projects could be found in my GitHub Page as well.
